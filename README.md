# Towards-a-Unified-Middle-Modality-Learning-for-Visible-Infrared-Person-Re-Identification

This repository is Pytorch code for our proposed MMN method [1] for Cross-Modality Person Re-Identification on RegDB dataset [2] and SYSU-MM01 dataset [3].

The results may have some fluctuation, and might be better by finetuning the hyper-parameters.
