# Towards-a-Unified-Middle-Modality-Learning-for-Visible-Infrared-Person-Re-Identification

[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475250)

This repository is Pytorch code for our proposed MMN method for Cross-Modality Person Re-Identification. 


### Training.
  Train a model by
  ```bash
python train.py --dataset sysu
```

  - `--dataset`: which dataset "sysu" or "regdb".

### Result.

The results may have some fluctuation, and might be better by finetuning the hyper-parameters.


|Datasets    | Rank@1   | mAP     |
| --------   | -----    |  -----  |
|#RegDB[1]      | ~ 91.6%  | ~ 84.1% |
|#SYSU-MM01[2]  | ~ 70.6%  | ~ 66.9% |
